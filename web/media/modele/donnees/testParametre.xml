	The monument is located in the middle of a cultivable area on the west coast of the 
Vistonida Lake, near Selino village in Xanthi, Greece. It is considered as one of the most important 
Ottoman monuments in the area and it may have been built in the 15th century. It was possibly built on
the ruins of an Orthodox Christian temple that was dedicated to Saint George Kalamitziotis. According to 
scholars, the term tekke (gathering place for Dervishes) is erroneous as the only remaining monument 
from a possible older building complex (tekke) is a tomb (türbe). Several conjectures have been made 
about the person buried in the monument. Today, for the Muslims it is considered as the grave of a 
Whirling Dervish named Kioutouklou Baba, while for the Christians it is a worshiping place of Saint 
George. It is composed by an octagonal türbe (mausoleum) and a domed antechamber. The türbe has a 25
domed roof, too, and two windows (at the east and south wall) and it is made of hewn 
stones.</description>
